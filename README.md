## About
The Spotify Running App is a front-end application which allows users to log into their spotify account and create a running playlist from their saved track library based on a set tempo and energy level, gathered from the Spotify Web API.

### TODO
- Add playlist data after filtered (eg. total playlist length, number of tracks, etc)
- Add instructions
- Add UX cues
- Final styling edits
