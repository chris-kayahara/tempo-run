## About
The Spotify Running App is a front-end application which allows users to log into their spotify account and create a running playlist from their saved track library based on a set tempo and energy level, gathered from the Spotify Web API.

### TODO
- Login page styling
- Create playlist title auto filled
- Add UX note for empty playlist (No songs in your library match the entered filter settings. Try a different tempo and/or energy setting)
- Final styling edits
