## About
The Spotify Running App is a front-end application which allows users to log into their spotify account and create a running playlist from their saved track library based on a set tempo and energy level, gathered from the Spotify Web API.

### TODO
- Fix font errors
- Disable CREATE PLAYLIST button when no tracks are available
- Edit toast to be pill shaped
- Add login-page animation
- Remove card bordering on login-page (maybe)
